# The-Matrix
A recreation of The Matrix in Windows, using the olc::PixelGameEngine. This doesn't use Katakana like the actual Matrix animation because the engine doesn't support Unicode, only ASCII. To build project, you simply need to open the Visual Studio Solution and run it, there are no external dependencies (the engine files is already in this repo). Again, it only works on Windows.
